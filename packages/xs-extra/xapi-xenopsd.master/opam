synopsis: "A single-host domain/VM manager for the Xen hypervisor"
description: """
The xenopsd daemon allows a set of VMs on a single host to be controlled
via a simple API. The API has been tailored to suit the needs of xapi,
which manages clusters of hosts running Xen, but it can also be used
standalone."""
