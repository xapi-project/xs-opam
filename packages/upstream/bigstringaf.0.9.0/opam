Bigstring intrinsics and fast blits based on memcpy/memmove

The OCaml compiler has a bunch of intrinsics for Bigstrings, but they're not
widely-known, sometimes misused, and so programs that use Bigstrings are slower
than they have to be. And even if a library got that part right and exposed the
intrinsics properly, the compiler doesn't have any fast blits between
Bigstrings and other string-like types.

So here they are. Go crazy."""
